About the project 

This project was created during a fullstack development bootcamp in Appsflyer company. 

I worked this project with 3 team members and each one of us was responsible for part of it. 

The website’s goal is to connect between mentee to mentors, presenting mentors by their skills and knowledge to help mentees (that are probably computer science students or a related field) 

Technologies used – for the frontend we used JavaScript, React, MUI and CSS. For the backend we used Node.JS, Express.js and mongoDB
